                NOW this is the next tale, and it tells how the Camel got his big
                hump. In the beginning of years, when the world was so new and all,
                and the Animals were just beginning to work for Man, there was a
                Camel, and he lived in the middle of a Howling Desert because he did
                not want to work; and besides, he was a Howler himself. So he ate
                sticks and thorns and tamarisks and milkweed and prickles, most
                'scruciating idle; and when anybody spoke to him he said 'Humph!' Just
                'Humph!' and no more. Presently the Horse came to him on Monday
                morning, with a saddle on his back and a bit in his mouth, and said,
                'Camel, O Camel, come out and trot like the rest of us.' 'Humph!' said
                the Camel; and the Horse went away and told the Man. Presently the Dog
                came to him, with a stick in his mouth, and said, 'Camel, O Camel,
                come and fetch and carry like the rest of us.'
